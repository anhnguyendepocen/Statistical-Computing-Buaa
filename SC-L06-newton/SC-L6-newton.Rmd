## Optimisation in Business

Many problems in business require something to be minimized or maximized.

- Maximizing Revenue
- Minimizing Costs
- Minimizing Delivery Time
- Maximizing Financial Returns

## Optimisation in Statistics

- Maximum Likelihood 
- Least Squares
- Method of Moments 
- Posterior Mode

## Optimisation

- Suppose we want to find a minimum or maximum of a function $f(x)$.
- Sometimes $f(x)$ will be very complicated.
- Are there computer algorithms that can help?
- Yes!

# Root Finding
## Root Finding

- Consider the problem of finding the root of a function.
- For the function $f(x)$, the root is the point $x^*$ such that $f(x^*) = 0$.
- An algorithm for solving this problem was proposed by Newton and Raphson nearly 500 years ago.


## Newton-Raphson Method

- Newton-Raphson is an iterative method that begins with an initial guess of the root. 
- The method uses the derivative of the function $f^{'}(x)$ as well as the original function $f(x)$.
- When successful,  it converges (usually) rapidly, but may fail as any other root-finding algorithm.

## Newton-Raphson Method

The method tries to solve an equation in the form of $f(x) = 0$ through the iterative procedure: $$x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f^{'}(x_n)}.$$

Please think about **Taylor expansion**.

## Geometric interpretation

</center>

## Stopping Rule

- With each step the algorithm should get closer to the root.
- However, it can run for a long time without reaching the exact root.
- There must be a stopping rule otherwise the program could run forever.
- Let $\epsilon$ be an extremely small number e.g. $1 \times 10^{-10}$ called the **tolerance level**.
- If $|f(x^{*})| < \epsilon$ then the solution is close enough and there is a root at $x^{*}$.

## Example

- Now find the root of $f(x) = x^2 - 5$ using Newton method by hand.
- Tell about its geometric interpretation.

## Newton-Raphson Method

1. Select an initial guess $x_0$, and set $n = 0$.
2. Set $x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f^{'}(x_n)}$.
3. Evaluate $|f(x_{n+1})|$.

    1. If $|f(x_{n+1})| < \epsilon$, then stop;
    2. Otherwise set $n=n+1$ and go back to step 2.
  


# Lab Session 5

## 

1. Write R code to find the root of $x^2 = 5$.
2. Now use your Newton-Raphson code to find the root of $f(x) = \sqrt{|x|}$. Try initial value 0.25.
3. Now use your Newton-Raphson code to find the root of $x e^{-x^2} = 0.4(e^x + 1)^{-1} + 0.2$. Try initial values 0.5 and 0.6.

What did you learn from mistakes?

## You can use `D()`

```r
newton.raphson <- function(f, init.value, df = NULL, tol = 1e-5, maxiter = 1000) {
  if (is.null(df)) {
    df <- D(f, 'x')
  }
  niter <- 0
  diff <- tol + 1
  x <- init.value
  while (diff >= tol && niter <= maxiter) {
    niter <- niter + 1
    fx <- eval(f)
    dfx <- eval(df)
    if (dfx == 0) {
      warning("Slope is zero: no further improvement possible.")
      break
    }
    diff <- -fx/dfx
    x <- x + diff
    diff <- abs(diff)
  }
  if (niter > maxiter) {
    warning("Maximum number of iterations 'maxiter' was reached.")
  }
  return(list(root = x, f.root = fx, niter = niter, estim.prec = diff))
}
```

## You can also use `deriv()`

```r
newton.raphson <- function(ftn, x0, tol = 1e-9, max.iter = 100) {
  # Newton_Raphson algorithm for solving ftn(x)[1] == 0
  # we assume that ftn is a function of a single variable that returns
  # the function value and the first derivative as a vector of length 2
  #
  # x0 is the initial guess at the root
  # the algorithm terminates when the function value is within distance
  # tol of 0, or the number of iterations exceeds max.iter
  
  # initialise
  x <- x0
  fx <- ftn(x)
  iter <-  0
  
  # continue iterating until stopping conditions are met
  while ((abs(fx[1]) > tol) && (iter < max.iter)) {
    x <- x - fx[1]/fx[2]
    fx <- ftn(x)
    iter <-  iter + 1
    cat("At iteration", iter, "value of x is:", x, "\n")
  }
  
  # output depends on success of algorithm
  if (abs(fx[1]) > tol) {
    cat("Algorithm failed to converge\n")
    return(NULL)
  } else {
    cat("Algorithm converged\n")
    return(x)
  }
}

f <- expression(x^2 - 5)
df <- deriv(f, 'x', func = TRUE)
ftn <- function(x){
  dfx <- df(x)
  f <- dfx[1]
  gradf <- attr(dfx, 'gradient')[1,]
  return(c(f, gradf))
}

newton.raphson(ftn, 1)
```

## Other Examples

Now try these functions:

1. $f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 11x + 12$, try starting values  2.35287527 and 2.35284172.
2. $f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 5$, try starting values  0.5 and 0.

## Learn from Mistakes

- Newton-Raphson does not always converge.
- For some functions, using some certain starting values leads to a series that converges, while other starting values lead to a series that diverges.
- For other functions different starting values converge to different roots.
- Be careful when choosing the initial value.
- Newton-Raphson doesn’t work if the first derivative is zero.




## Conclusion

- Why did we spend so much time on finding roots of an equation?
- Isn’t this topic meant to be about optimization?
- Can we change the algorithm slightly so that it works for optimization?

# Optimisation

## Finding a Maximum or Minimum

- Suppose we want to find an minimum or maximum of a function $f(x)$ (think about maximum likelihood estimation).
- Find the derivative $f^{'}(x)$  and find $x^{*}$ such that $f^{'}(x^*) = 0$.
- This is the same as finding a root of the first derivative. We can use the Newton Raphson algorithm on the first derivative.

## Newton Raphson algorithm for finding local maxima or minima


1. Select an initial guess $x_0$, and set $n = 0$.
2. Set $x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f^{'}(x_n)}{f^{''}(x_n)}$.
3. Evaluate $|f^{'}(x_{n+1})|$.

    1. If $|f^{'}(x_{n+1})| < \epsilon$, then stop;
    2. Otherwise set $n=n+1$ and go back to step 2.
 
## Different Stopping Rules

Three stopping rules can be used.

- $|f^{'}(x_{n+1})| < \epsilon$.
- $|x_{n} - x_{n-1}| < \epsilon$.
- $|f(x_{n}) - f(x_{n-1})| < \epsilon$.

## Intuition

- Focus the step size $-\frac{f'(x)}{f''(x)}$.
- The signs of the derivatives control the direction of the next step.
- The size of the derivatives control the size of the next step.
- Consider the concave function $f(x)=-x^4$ which has $f'(x)=-4x^3$ and $f''(x)=-12x^2$. There is a maximum at $x^{*}=0$.

</center>

## Role of first derivative


- If $f''(x)$ is negative the function is locally concave, and the search is for a local maximum.
- To the left of this maximum $f'(x)>0$.
- Therefore $-\frac{f'(x)}{f''(x)}>0$.
- The next step is to the right.
- The reverse holds if $f'(x)<0$.
- Large absolute values of $f'(x)$ imply a steep slope.  A big step is needed to get close to the optimum.  The reverse hold for small absolute value of $f'(x)$.

## Role of first derivative
- If $f''(x)$ is positive the function is locally  convex, and the search is for a local minimum.
- To the left of this maximum $f'(x)<0$.
- Therefore $-\frac{f'(x)}{f''(x)}>0$.
- The next step is to the right.
- The reverse holds if $f'(x)>0$.
- Large absolute values of $f'(x)$ imply a steep slope.  A big step is needed to get close to the optimum.  The reverse hold for small absolute value of $f'(x)$.

## Role of second derivative
<center>
![Newton Method](RCode/climb4.pdf)
</center>

## Role of second derivative
- Together with the sign of the first derivative, the sign of the second derivative controls the direction of the next step.
- A larger second derivative (in absolute value) implies a larger curvature.
- In this case smaller steps are need to stop the algorithm from overshooting.
- The opposite holds for a small second derivative.





# Multidimensional Optimization

## Functions with more than one input

- Most interesting optimization problems involve multiple inputs.
    - In determining the most risk efficient portfolio the return is a function of many weights (one for each asset).
    - In least squares estimation for a linear regression model, the sum of squares is a function of many coefficients (one for each regressor).
- How do we optimize for functions $f({x})$ where ${x}$ is a vector?

## Derviatives

- Newton's algorithm has a simple update rule based on first and second derivatives.
- What do these derivatives look like when the function is $y=f({x})$ where $y$ is a scalar and $\mathbf{x}$ is a $d\times 1$ vector?

## First derivative

Simply take the partial derivatives and put them in a vector
$$
    \frac{\partial y}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}}=
    \left(
      \begin{array}{c}
        \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_1}\\
        \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_2}\\
        \vdots\\
        \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_d}
      \end{array}
    \right)$$
This is called the gradient vector.

## An example

The function $y=x_1^2-x_1x_2+x_2^2+e^{x_2}$ has gradient vector

$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
                                               2x_1-x_2\\
                                               -x_1+2x_2+e^{x_2}
                                             \end{array}
                                           \right).$$
                                           
## Second derivative
Simply take the second order partial derivatives.  This will give a matrix
$$
                                           \frac{\partial y}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}\partial{\mathbf{x}}'}=
                                           \left(
                                             \begin{array}{cccc}
                                               \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x_1^2}&\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x_1\partial x_2}&\cdots&\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x_1\partial x_d}\\
                                               \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x_2\partial x_1}&\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x_2^2}&\cdots&\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x_2\partial x_d}\\
                                               \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
                                               \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x_d\partial x_1}&\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x_d\partial x_2}&\cdots&\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x_d^2}\\
                                             \end{array}
                                           \right).$$

This is called the Hessian matrix.

## An example
The function $y=x_1^2-x_1x_2+x_2^2+e^{x_2}$ has Hessian matrix
$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial{\mathbf{x}}\partial{ \mathbf{x}}'}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
                                                                                                      2 & -1\\
                                                                                                      -1 & 2 + e^{x_2}
                                                                                                    \end{array}
                                                                                                  \right)
                                           $$

## Newton’s algorithm for multidimensional optimization

We can now generalise the update step in Newton's method:
                                                                      $$ \mathbf{x_{n+1}}=\mathbf{x_n}-\left(\frac{\partial^2 f({ \mathbf{x}})}{\partial {\mathbf{x}}\partial{\mathbf{x}}'}\right)^{-1}
                                                                                                  \frac{\partial f({\mathbf{x}})}{\partial {\mathbf{x}}}$$

Now write code to minimise $y=x_1^2-x_1x_2+x_2^2+e^{x_2}$.



## Maximum likelihood Estimate for linear models

Assume you want to make a regression model
$$
     y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i} + \epsilon_i,~\text{where}~\epsilon_i \sim N(0, 1).
$$


- How do we estimate the parameters? 
- Write down the log likelihood function with respect to the unknown parameters.
- Write down the gradient for the log likelihood function.
- Write down the Hessian for the log likelihood function.
- Use your newton function to obtain the best parameter estimate.

## Optimizing Using Newton's Method

```{r}
## Generate some data
beta0 <- 1
beta1 <- 3
sigma <- 1
n <- 1000
x <- rnorm(n, 3, 1)
y <- beta0 + x * beta1 + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sigma)
# plot(x, y, col = "blue", pch = 20)

## Make the log normal likelihood function
func = function(beta){
  sum((y-beta[1]-beta[2]*x)^2)
}

grad = function(beta){
  matrix(c(sum(-2*(y-beta[1]-beta[2]*x)),sum(-2*x*(y-beta[1]-beta[2]*x))),2,1)
}

hess = function(beta){
  matrix(c(2*length(x),2*sum(x),2*sum(x),2*sum(x^2)),2,2)
}

## The optimization
source('./RCode/newton.R')
optimOut <- newton(function(beta){list(func(beta), grad(beta), hess(beta))}, c(-4, -5))
beta0Hat <- optimOut[1]
beta1Hat <- optimOut[2]
yHat <- beta0Hat + beta1Hat * x

## Plot
plot(x, y, pch = 20, col = "blue")
points(sort(x), yHat[order(x)], type = "l", col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

## Comparison with OLS

```{r}
myLM <- lm(y~x)
myLMCoef <- myLM$coefficients
yHatOLS <- myLMCoef[1] + myLMCoef[2] * x
plot(x, y, pch = 20, col = "blue")
points(sort(x), yHat[order(x)], type = "l", col = "red", lwd = 10)
points(sort(x), yHatOLS[order(x)], type = "l",
       col = "blue", lty="dashed", lwd = 2, pch = 20)
```
